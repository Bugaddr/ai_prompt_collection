Generate a data-driven profile of the top 5 research-oriented Interventional <speciality> in <city_name>. For each professional, provide a report structured as follows:

4. Verified Patient Sentiment: Summarize patient feedback from independent platforms (Google, Practo), filtering for comments specifically mentioning 'diagnosis accuracy' and 'ethical practice' rather than hospital amenities.
5. Public Integrity Check: Search for any mentions in the Medical Council of India (NMC) registries or local news regarding clinical controversies or malpractice litigation.
6. Clinical Focus: Specify if they specialize in a niche (e.g., Pediatric Cardiology, Electrophysiology, or Structural Heart Disease) to match my specific needs.
