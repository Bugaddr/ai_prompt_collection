Generate 5-8 weird, extreme, and mostly tongue-in-cheek money-saving "hacks" that exploit massive price or tax differences for everyday or luxury items across countries, states, or cities — similar to flying to Vietnam to buy cheap cigarettes in bulk to offset the airfare, or going to Goa for cheap liquor, or Dubai for duty-free gold and electronics.

Each idea should:
- Identify a specific item or category (alcohol, tobacco, electronics, gold/jewelry, cosmetics, luxury goods, fuel, groceries, etc.) that is heavily taxed or marked up in one place (preferably India or high-tax regions).
- Compare it to a much cheaper location (nearby countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Dubai, Singapore, or states like Goa, Pondicherry, etc.).
- Calculate rough numbers: current price in expensive location, price in cheap location, travel cost (flight/train/bus + short stay), and how many units you'd need to buy for the savings to cover or exceed the trip cost.
- Frame it as "turn the trip into a mini-vacation" or "make the most of it — travel, explore, save taxes."
- Keep the tone humorous and over-the-top, while noting that these are impractical for most people and health/long-term costs outweigh the savings.
- End with a disclaimer like the original: be thankful you're not in even more expensive places (e.g., Australia, Europe).

Focus on ideas relevant to Indian consumers if possible, but include global ones too. Make them creative and fun.
